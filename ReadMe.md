## BUSDPortal

This project uses react, ethers and web3 modal to create a decentralized application that transfers tokens from a senders wallet to a receipients wallet. To interact with this dapp, you will need a to import a private key that has access to the testnet tokens used in the dapp. The private key can be found at the .env file in the chain folder. We will be using sepolia testnet for this project. So you need to import the private key into your metamask wallet and you are set. A sepolia node rpc has been provided too, for safety reasons.

Each folder contains a readme file that talks specifically on what the folder represents. i hope you enjoy this.
